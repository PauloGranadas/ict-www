  In this module we will use
  <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML
  </abbr> and
<abbr title="Cascate Style Sheets">
    CSS
  </abbr>.
</p>
<pre>
    A      certain HTML element    allows
     text to be displayed as it is entered in the editor.
            This is called
                'preformatted'.

  Example of a CSS rule:
<code>
        body {
        color: #ff0000;
        font-family: Arial, Verdana;
        }
</code>
</pre>

      To boot an Ubuntu operating system, you need to type the command <kbd>sudo reboot in 0 </kbd>in the
        <br>
      terminal and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. After that, the operating system responds with the
        <br>
      message <em>The system is going down and the PC shuts down</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Very important</strong> words or text passages are highlighted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Words or text passages that are <em>emphasized</em> when speaking can <em>also</em> be emphasized in HTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    A text can be <mark>highlighted</mark>, like with a text marker.
  </p>
  <p>
    In mathematics, some text is <sup>serscripted</sup> or <sub>subscripted</sub>, just like &pi;<sup>2</sup>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The text in the footer is often <small>printed small</small>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course you can combine all these HTML elements. Whether this <em>always makes <strong>sense,</strong></em>
  <br>
   however, is questionable. In any case, make sure that the elements are <em>always nested<br>
   correctly</em> and always follow the basic rule: the <strong>first opened</strong> element is <strong>closed last</strong>.
